A Feedforward Neural Network is the simplest type of artificial neural network:

Key Features:
 - Data flows in one direction → from input → to hidden layers → to output.

 - No loops or cycles.

 - Often used in basic tasks like classification or regression.

```python
Input → Hidden Layer → Output

output = activation(weights * input + bias)
```


# Full Breakdown of a Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)


1. Definition

A Feedforward Neural Network (FFN) is the most basic type of neural network where:

 - Information flows only forward from the input to the output.

 - There are no cycles or feedback connections.

2. Main Components

 - An FFN consists of:

 - Input Layer

 - One or more Hidden Layers

 - Output Layer

 - Weights and Biases

 - Activation Functions

3. Input Layer

 - Accepts input features from the dataset.

 - Each neuron represents a feature.

 - Example: For 3 input features [x1, x2, x3], the input layer has 3 neurons.

4. Weights and Biases

 - Each connection between neurons has a weight (w) and bias (b).

 - These are the parameters the network learns.

 - Initially, weights and biases are usually randomly initialized.

5. Linear Transformation

 - Each neuron performs a weighted sum:



```python
z = w₁·x₁ + w₂·x₂ + ... + wₙ·xₙ + b
```
Or in vector notation:

```python
z = W·x + b
```


Where:

 - W = weight matrix

 - x = input vector

 - b = bias vector
