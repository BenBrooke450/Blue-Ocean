# What Is an Embedding Layer?
An embedding layer is a component in a neural network that converts tokenized input (discrete token IDs) into dense vectors of real numbers that capture semantic meaning.


`token_id = 123
embedding = embedding_layer(token_id)  # → [0.12, -0.87, 0.03, ..., 0.45]`


## What Does the Vector Represent?
Each embedding vector represents semantic properties of the token:
 - Tokens with similar meanings have closer vectors in space.

 - For example, **king, queen, monarch** might lie close together in the embedding space.

 - This lets the model reason about meaning early in the processing pipeline.



```
import torch.nn as nn

embedding_layer = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=50000, embedding_dim=768)
```

 - You now have a 50,000 × 768 matrix.

 - Each row corresponds to one token.

 - The row's values are the embedding vector for that token.



## Why Choose a Certain embedding_dim?
 - Higher embedding_dim → captures more nuanced meaning, but increases:
   - Memory usage
   - Model size
   - Risk of overfitting (if too high and data is limited)

 - Lower embedding_dim → more efficient, but may lack expressiveness.

In practice, you want the embedding_dim to match the hidden size of your transformer layers for compatibility.
